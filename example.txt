The append_buffer function takes two arguments: 
char *basin_buffer and char *read_buffer. 

The purpose of this function is to concatenate the contents of 
read_buffer to the end of basin_buffer and return the updated combined 
string. To achieve this without causing any memory issues, the function 
handles memory allocation and pointer reassignment smartly.

When the append_buffer function is called, it receives the memory address 
of basin_buffer as its first argument and the memory address of read_buffer 
as its second argument. Since these are pointers, they represent memory 
addresses rather than the actual data.

To perform the concatenation, the function needs to create a new buffer 
that is large enough to hold the combined data. The function dynamically 
allocates memory for the new basin_buffer using the ft_strjoin function, 
which takes the old basin_buffer and the read_buffer as arguments, and 
concatenates them together into a new buffer. Crucially, the ft_strjoin 
function ensures that sufficient memory is allocated for the new buffer, 
considering both sets of data.

After the data is successfully combined in the new basin_buffer, the function 
then reassigns the pointer basin_buffer to point to the new memory address 
containing the merged data. This is the smart reassignment that allows the 
function to update the original basin_buffer outside of the function.

By reassigning basin_buffer, the function effectively updates the original 
pointer outside the function's scope. Now, the original basin_buffer points 
to the newly created buffer that holds the merged data from both buffers 
(basin_buffer and read_buffer).

This smart reassignment ensures that the caller of the append_buffer 
function receives the updated pointer, pointing to the combined data, 
and any further operations or usage of basin_buffer outside the function 
will reflect the changes made within the function.

In conclusion, the append_buffer function demonstrates the concept of 
passing pointers to modify the original pointer's value, allowing for 
efficient data concatenation without causing memory leaks or loss of data. 
This smart memory management and pointer reassignment make the function 
reliable and safe when dealing with dynamically allocated memory in C.
